# ðŸ¦´ backbonefx

BackboneFX is tiny library that provides the tools to base your application design. It's meant to be lightweight and simple, so if you like [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and avoid bulky frameworks above frameworks with multi-page manuals go and try it.

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.mkpaz</groupId>
    <artifactId>backbonefx</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```

## Tools

* [Feather](https://github.com/zsoltherpai/feather) - ultra-lightweight dependency injection (JSR-330). Minimal footprint and startup time.
* Event Bus - simple single-class implementation.
* [MVVM](https://wikipedia.org/wiki/Modelâ€“viewâ€“viewmodel) - core API for implementing the pattern, just the `View`, `ViewModel` and `Command`.

BackboneFX is well documented. You can find the explanation and examples in Javadoc (**TBD**).
